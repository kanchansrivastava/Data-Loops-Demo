# Kobo-Happiness-Demo
This app is designed as a proof-of-concept to show how ODK forms can be integrated into a custom mobile application and allow for continuous data loops.

The app does the following things:
1. Connect to remote forms hosted in a kobo-toolbox repository
2. Load the forms within an app tab to allow for data entry and submission
3. Connect back to the remote repository to feedback all results into the app

To build the app you will need to install Ionic Framework - Instructions at: http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/

You can see a preview of the app in your browser here or on a mobile here
